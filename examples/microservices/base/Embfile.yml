    # Restrict this task to run only on the local machine (not inside a container).
    # By default, tasks can run on multiple executors (local, container).
    # Setting 'executors: [local]' means:
    # - The task runs on your host machine only
    # - Attempting to run with --executor=container will fail
    # - Useful for tasks that need host-level access or don't make sense in a container
