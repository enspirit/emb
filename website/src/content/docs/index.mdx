## Why EMB?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Auto-Discovery" icon="magnifier">
		EMB automatically discovers components in your monorepo. Any folder with a Dockerfile becomes a buildable component.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Smart Dependencies" icon="random">
		Define dependencies between images and EMB builds them in the right order.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Consistent Workflow" icon="rocket">
		Use the same commands across all projects: `emb build`, `emb up`, `emb logs`.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Flavors" icon="setting">
		Define different configurations for development, staging, and production using JSON Patch.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install EMB
npm install -g @enspirit/emb

# In your monorepo
emb components    # See discovered components
emb build         # Build all images
emb up            # Start services
```
